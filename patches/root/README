Hi Cloud Rider,

Welcome to the LEMP image, this is a playground upon which you can
build and deploy PHP/MySQL applications, the following are installed
and configured:

- nginx
- memcached
- php (with useful modules such as APC, gd, ...)
- mysql
- phpmyadmin
- composer

The folder `/var/www/my_website` contains your website (for now, it is a phpinfo).

Useful links:

- https://github.com/online-labs/image-app-lemp
- http://your-ip/phpmyadmin
- http://your-ip/

The MySQL credentials are:

- login: root 
- password: {mysql_root_password}

Your website configuration lies at:

- /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_website

We recommend you to have a look at it (if you need to disable
phpmyadmin or to add a domain name, this is the place you are looking
for).

Enjoy!
